# Hunt Creek
All scripts and data analysis associated with the Hunt Creek translocation event and subsequent genetic analysis (Weise et al 2020). 

## Guide to navigating the repository:
The repository structure mirrors the Methods section in Weise et al 2020. There are 4 folders that contain a different type of analysis. Each folder contains an input and output folder, as well as a source folder that contains scripts for required source functions. Finally, there is a script that will run the analysis. If multiple scripts are required in each folder, they are numbered and should be executed in numerical order.

Note: In the power analysis folder, the output of the first script is run through the pedigree reconstruction program Colony (Wang 2009), and the Best.config output from the Colony program is used in the second script.
